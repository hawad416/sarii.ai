Sarii AI : ChatGPT for University Student Support 

Existing resources each make tradeoffs between speed, relevance, and trust:

- Public University Documentation (Immediately available, but not easy to search or always up to date):
    - Speed ✅
    - Relevance or easy to find?❌
    - Trust ✅
- Community (Friendly, but not sure if answers are trustworthy):
    - Speed ✅
    - Relevance  or easy to find?✅
    - Trust ❌
- Advisors and University Staff: Relevant and trustworthy answers, but usually very slow or understaffed : ( ):
    - Speed ❌
    - Relevance (MEDIUM) bc sometimes they just dont have the time to know everything going on campus or can't share every single resource w every single student
    - Trust ✅’
    
    EDSTEM: Relevant and trustworthy answers, but usually slow and also not every major has access to it
    
    - Speed ❌
    - Relevance ✅
    - Trust ✅

responses and data to UW.
