AI-Powered Search for University Documentation.  

university documentation is typically outdated, hard to search through, and hard to extract relevant data from.  let's fix that!

sarii.ai brings AI-Powered University documentation search. sarii ai simplifies the process by which University of Washington (UW) students gain access to crucial university information. we leverage state of the art fine-tuned language models ( technologies such as generative AI, gpt, llama-index, and web application tools like nextjs and react)  to offer a personalized and seamless user experience that enables students to obtain accurate, reliable, and timely answers to all their questions and concerns extracted directly from the university documentation.

for the first launch, we have onboarded ~ 20 new incoming transfer students to the University of Washington to help ease their transition into the new environment and analyze major pain points in information search.
