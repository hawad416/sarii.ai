AI-Powered Search for University Documentation.  

university documentation is typically outdated, hard to search through, and hard to extract relevant data from. sarii.ai brings AI-Powered University documentation search.  

our mission is to simplify the process by which University of Washington (UW) students gain access to crucial university information. Our platform leverages technologies such as generative AI, gpt, llama-index, and web application tools like nextjs and react, to offer a personalized and seamless user experience that enables students to obtain accurate, reliable, and timely answers to all their questions and concerns extracted directly from the university documentation. By fine tuning to the specific university, sarii.ai offers  personalized and dynamic virtual assistant,  enhancing the accessibility and usability of university documentation.


for the first launch, we have onboarded ~ 20 new incoming transfer students to the University of Washington to help ease their transition into the new environment and analyze major pain points in information search.
