ChatGPT for University Student Support 

sarii.ai represents a groundbreaking project that aims to transform and democratize the process by which University of Washington (UW) students gain access to crucial university information, including academic and personal guidance, course information, career opportunities, events, and more. Our platform leverages cutting-edge technologies such as generative AI and machine learning models, as well as state-of-the-art web application tools, to offer a personalized and seamless user experience that enables students to obtain accurate, reliable, and timely answers to all their questions and concerns.

By incorporating UW's data and specific requirements, sarii.ai serves as a personalized and dynamic virtual assistant, providing students with quick and efficient solutions to their needs. Our innovative approach not only enhances the accessibility and usability of university information but also streamlines communication between students and university teams across the campus.


Existing resources each make tradeoffs between speed, relevance, and trust:

- Public University Documentation (Immediately available, but not easy to search or always up to date):
    - Speed ✅
    - Relevance or easy to find?❌
    - Trust ✅
- Community (Friendly, but not sure if answers are trustworthy):
    - Speed ✅
    - Relevance  or easy to find?✅
    - Trust ❌
- Advisors and University Staff: Relevant and trustworthy answers, but usually very slow or understaffed : ( ):
    - Speed ❌
    - Relevance (MEDIUM) bc sometimes they just dont have the time to know everything going on campus or can't share every single resource w every single student
    - Trust ✅’
    
    EDSTEM: Relevant and trustworthy answers, but usually slow and also not every major has access to it
    
    - Speed ❌
    - Relevance ✅
    - Trust ✅

We help bridge these gaps by either providing your students a direct interface for help or by enabling your advising and university teams to quickly search and generate answers using our flows, so they can best help students.
