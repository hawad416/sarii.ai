CSE 601 offers students the opportunity to explore and develop their careers through professional practice. The structured plan of education impacts student work-readiness through a number of professional development skill-building activities. Students will provide a brief final report on their experiences. After completing the course, graduate students earn credit towards their degree with CSE 601 listed on their permanent transcript.

CSE 601 is open to graduate students with a part-time internship or a full-time internship during the summer. Students with a full-time internship during the academic year (fall, winter, spring) should sign up for ENGR 601, through the College of Engineeringâ€™s Internship Program.
